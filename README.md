# 🏗️ Dev Pipeline Skills for Claude

A comprehensive 6-phase development pipeline that turns Claude into a senior engineering team. From idea to production-ready, tested, documented code — using structured AI skills.

```
Brainstorm/Investigation → Planning → Implementation → Code Review → Testing → Documentation
```

## What Is This?

A collection of **Claude AI skills** (structured instruction files) that guide Claude through a complete software development lifecycle for JavaScript/TypeScript projects. Each skill contains detailed processes, checklists, best practices, and reference materials that Claude reads and follows.

**Think of it as a senior engineering team's playbook, optimized for AI.**

## Features

- 🧠 **Brainstorm** — Deep-dive requirements gathering with conversational questioning
- 🔎 **Investigation** — Systematic debugging, root cause analysis, refactoring assessment, performance investigation
- 📋 **Planning** — Task breakdown with dependencies, acceptance criteria, file structure, and archived plans in `docs/plans/`
- ⚡ **Implementation** — Batch execution with quality gates, tech stack detection, and self-review
- 🔍 **Code Review** — 18-area strict review with 4-level severity and actionable fix plans
- 🧪 **Testing** — 5 test types, >80% coverage target, auto-detect runner, generate-run-fix loop, failure recovery (skip or loop back to implementation)
- 📝 **Documentation** — 7 doc types generated from actual code (README, API, architecture, deployment, etc.)

### Bonus: Reference Materials

- **JS/TS Best Practices** — TypeScript patterns, Node.js, modern JS, security, performance, design patterns, algorithms
- **Web Frameworks** — Express, Fastify, Hono, Next.js API routes — routing, middleware, error handling, project setup
- **Frontend Frameworks** — React, Next.js App Router, Vue 3 Composition API — components, hooks, state management, testing
- **SQL Databases** — PostgreSQL + MySQL with Prisma, Drizzle, and raw driver patterns
- **NoSQL Databases** — MongoDB + DynamoDB with Mongoose and AWS SDK patterns
- **Redis** — Caching, sessions, rate limiting, queues, pub/sub
- **Review Checklists** — Deep checklists for all 18 code review areas
- **Test Patterns** — Vitest reference, component testing, MSW mocking, factories, anti-patterns

## Installation

### Claude Code (CLI)

#### Plugin Marketplace

```bash
/plugin marketplace add git@github.com:ykondrat/yk-dev-pipeline-skills.git
/plugin install yk-dev-pipeline@yk-dev-pipeline-skills
```

After installation, restart Claude Code to apply changes.

**Verify installation:**
```bash
/plugin list
```

**Uninstall:**
```bash
/plugin uninstall yk-dev-pipeline
```

### Claude.ai Projects

1. Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) → **Projects** → **Create Project**
2. Click **Add Knowledge** → upload the `plugins/yk-dev-pipeline/skills/` folder contents
3. Add this to **Project Instructions**:

```
You have access to the YK Dev Pipeline skills in your project knowledge.

Available skills:
- yk-dev-pipeline (router - start here for all requests)
- yk-brainstorm (Phase 1a: Requirements for new features)
- yk-investigation (Phase 1b: Bug fixes, refactoring, performance)
- yk-planning (Phase 2: Task breakdown)
- yk-implementation (Phase 3: Code writing)
- yk-code-review (Phase 4: Review)
- yk-testing (Phase 5: Tests)
- yk-documentation (Phase 6: Docs)

When I request development work, read the appropriate SKILL.md file and follow
its instructions. Start with skills/SKILL.md to understand the pipeline.

Always read reference files when the skill instructs you to.
```

### Claude.ai Chat (One-time Use)

1. Download this repository as ZIP
2. Start a new conversation at [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
3. Drag the ZIP into the chat
4. Say: **"Read plugins/yk-dev-pipeline/skills/SKILL.md and help me build [your project]"**

## Quick Start

📖 **[Read the complete USAGE.md guide](USAGE.md)** for detailed instructions, workflows, and examples.

After installation, just say: **"Build me a REST API for a task management app"** — Claude will start the pipeline automatically.

                          │           (if blocked, loops back
                          │            to Implementation)
                          │
                 (if tests keep failing,
                  user chooses: skip or
                  loop back to Implementation)
```

Each phase:
- Reads the previous phase's output
- Follows its SKILL.md instructions
- Produces artifacts for the next phase
- Updates `pipeline-state.json` for tracking

## Customization

These skills are designed to be forked and customized:

- **Add your own conventions** — edit the style/naming sections to match your team
- **Add/remove review areas** — edit `code-review/SKILL.md` and `references/review-checklists.md`
- **Change coverage targets** — edit `testing/SKILL.md`
- **Add frameworks** — extend with Angular, Svelte, NestJS, etc. (React, Vue, Express, Fastify, Hono, Next.js already covered)
- **Change defaults** — swap Vitest for Jest, Prisma for Drizzle, etc.

## How It Works Under the Hood

Claude AI skills are markdown files with structured instructions. When Claude reads a SKILL.md file, it follows the instructions as a detailed playbook. The key principles:

1. **Progressive loading** — Claude reads only the skills it needs for the current phase, not everything at once
2. **Reference on demand** — Deep checklists and best practices are in separate files, loaded when needed
3. **Artifact chaining** — Each phase produces files (spec.md, plan.md, etc.) that the next phase reads. Plans and design docs are also archived in `docs/plans/` with date prefixes
4. **State tracking** — `pipeline-state.json` tracks progress across phases
5. **Human in the loop** — Claude suggests the next phase, but waits for user confirmation
6. **Router-first routing** — The pipeline router handles all general requests ("build me...", "fix this bug", "next step") and routes to the correct phase using intent detection rules and pipeline state. Individual phases only trigger on explicit phase-name mentions.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

Areas where contributions are welcome:
- Additional reference materials (Angular, Svelte, NestJS, tRPC patterns)
- Language-specific adaptations (Python, Go, Rust)
- Infrastructure patterns (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD)
- Bug fixes and improvements to existing skills

## Publishing to Marketplaces

This skill collection is structured as a **Claude Code plugin marketplace** repo. It can be installed via:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add git@github.com:ykondrat/yk-dev-pipeline-skills.git
/plugin install yk-dev-pipeline@yk-dev-pipeline-skills
```

The `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at the repo root defines the marketplace catalog, and `plugins/yk-dev-pipeline/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` provides the plugin manifest. Skills are auto-discovered from the `skills/` directory within the plugin.

## Security

⚠️ **Important**: Always review skills before installation, especially from untrusted sources.

This skill collection:
- Contains only markdown instruction files (no executable code)
- Has no external dependencies
- Does not make network requests
- Does not access credentials or sensitive data

## License
