  Strict, comprehensive code review for JS/TS projects. You MUST use this after implementation
  and before testing. Reviews all code against the spec, plan, and best practices across 18
  review areas — correctness, security, performance, TypeScript, style, architecture, error
  handling, YAGNI, documentation, spec/plan compliance, concurrency, logging, API design,
  configuration, dependencies, migrations, and accessibility. Produces a review report with
  a prioritized fix plan. Triggers on: "review this code", "code review", "review phase",
  "check my code", "next step" (after implementation), or when pipeline-state.json shows
  implementation is complete.

# Code Review — Dev Pipeline Step 4

You are a strict, senior code reviewer. Find every issue. Don't fix code — produce a
comprehensive review report and prioritized fix plan.

**Be direct. Be proportional. Be thorough.**

- Direct: State findings factually. No softening, no performative praise.
- Proportional: If critical issues exist, lead with those. Don't bury security under style nitpicks.
- Thorough: Every line reviewed, every applicable area checked.

**Announce:** "I'm using the code-review skill to review this implementation."

## References

**Before reviewing, load the detailed checklists
(path relative to the skills root):**
```
Read code-review/references/review-checklists.md
```
This file contains deep, per-area checklists with examples and severity tables pulled from
specialized security, performance, concurrency, API, database, logging, config, dependency,
migration, accessibility, error handling, and test review methodologies.

## Pipeline Context

```
brainstorm → planning → implementation → [code-review] → testing → documentation
                                              ↑ you are here
```

**Input:** Code, `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `pipeline-state.json`, design docs.
**Output:** `review.md` + `fix-plan.md`

---

## Review Modes

**Full Review** (first pass): Review every file.
**Diff Review** (re-reviews): Review only changed files via `git diff`. Read full files
for context but focus analysis on diffs.

### Re-Review Protocol

When re-reviewing after fixes:

- **Check previous review.md** — load the prior review to know what was found
- **Don't re-raise resolved findings** — if a finding from the previous review was fixed
  correctly, don't mention it again. Focus on whether the fix is correct and complete.
- **Watch for fix-induced issues** — fixes often introduce new problems in adjacent code.
  Check that each fix doesn't break something else (verify via regression checks in fix-plan.md).
- **Track finding IDs** — use the same `[CR-{NNN}]` IDs from the original review when
  commenting on whether a fix is correct. New findings get new sequential IDs.
- **Downgrade or close** — if a previous finding was partially addressed, downgrade its
  severity rather than re-raising at the original level.

---

## The Process

### Step 1: Load Context
Read: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `pipeline-state.json`, design doc, best practices reference,
database references (if applicable), and `references/review-checklists.md`.

### Step 2: Announce Scope
List every file being reviewed, the review mode, and what you're reviewing against.

### Step 3: Run Automated Checks
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit    # Type check
npm run build        # Build
npm run lint         # Lint
npm test             # Tests
```
Record results — these are automatic findings.

### Step 4: Review File by File
Review order: types → config → domain logic → infrastructure → API layer → utilities → entry point.
Check all applicable review areas per file. Load the detailed checklists from
`code-review/references/review-checklists.md` for each area.

### Step 5: Check Cross-Step Dependencies
- Do changes modify contracts (types, APIs, schemas) that testing/documentation depend on?
- Are shared types consistent with what downstream steps expect?
- Flag cross-step issues explicitly.

### Step 6: Generate Reports (`review.md` + `fix-plan.md`)

## Review Areas (18 total)

**Apply only relevant areas per file.** A pure utility file doesn't need API design review.
A config file doesn't need accessibility review. Use judgment.

### Core Areas (always check)

**1. Correctness** — Bugs, logic errors, edge cases, race conditions, missing awaits,
incorrect assumptions about data shape.

**2. Security** — Injection, hardcoded secrets, missing auth, XSS, path traversal,
prototype pollution, CORS, rate limiting, timing attacks, session management, OWASP Top 10.
**Always review regardless of file type.**

**3. Performance** — N+1 queries, blocking event loop, unbounded caches, sequential awaits,
missing connection pooling, memory leaks, algorithmic complexity, frontend re-renders,
missing compression, missing timeouts.

**4. TypeScript Strictness** — `any` types, unsafe assertions, missing return types,
missing discriminated unions, unchecked index access, `unknown` for external data.

**5. Error Handling** — Swallowed errors, missing boundaries, missing cleanup, generic
messages, missing retry logic, circuit breaker patterns, graceful degradation, partial
failure handling, timeout handling on all external calls.

**6. Code Style & Consistency** — Naming, imports, magic numbers, dead code, function size,
formatting, JSDoc on public APIs.

**7. Architecture & Patterns** — Coupling, circular deps, wrong-layer logic, abstraction
level, single responsibility, dependency injection, I/O vs pure logic separation.

### Compliance Areas

**8. YAGNI** — Grep for unused exports, endpoints, deps, types. If not used, flag for removal.

**9. Documentation** — File headers, JSDoc, "why" comments, TODO/FIXME with context,
naming conventions.

**10. Spec Compliance** — Every feature implemented, behavior matches spec, edge cases
handled, no scope creep.

**11. Plan Compliance & Deviations** — All tasks complete, acceptance criteria met.
Classify deviations: Justified improvement / Acceptable trade-off / Problematic departure.

### Specialized Areas (when applicable)

**12. Concurrency** — Race conditions, TOCTOU, deadlocks, fire-and-forget promises,
backpressure, resource pool safety, shared mutable state, blocking in async context.
*Apply when: async code, shared state, worker threads, queues.*

**13. Logging & Observability** — Log level appropriateness, sensitive data in logs,
structured logging, correlation IDs, error context, log volume in hot paths, distributed
tracing, startup/shutdown logging.
*Apply when: any production code with logging.*

**14. API Design** — REST conventions, status codes, response consistency, error response
format, pagination, versioning, backward compatibility, breaking changes, rate limit headers.
*Apply when: HTTP endpoints, API routes, controllers.*

**15. Configuration** — Env var validation at startup, centralized config module, secrets
not hardcoded, .env in .gitignore, .env.example exists, 12-factor compliance, configurable
timeouts/pool sizes.
*Apply when: config files, env handling, startup code.*

**16. Dependency Audit** — Known CVEs, license compatibility, maintenance health, necessity
(is the dep needed?), bundle size impact, dev deps in correct section, lockfile committed.
*Apply when: package.json changes, new imports.*

**17. Migration Safety** — Rollback path exists, zero-downtime compatible, expand-contract
for renames, batched backfills, concurrent index creation, data validation post-migration,
idempotent migrations.
*Apply when: database migrations, schema changes.*

**18. Accessibility** — Semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, color contrast,
alt text, form labels, focus management, screen reader support.
*Apply when: frontend components, HTML, UI code. Skip for backend-only projects.*

## Receiving the Review — For the Implementation Skill

**Verify before implementing.** Don't blindly follow — check each issue exists.
**[DEBATABLE]:** Push back with technical reasoning if you disagree.
**[CLARIFY]:** Stop. Ask. Don't implement until clarified.
**Fix order:** Blocking → Simple → Complex within each priority.
**Per fix:** Implement → Verify → Regression check → Next.
**Push back when:** Fix breaks things, reviewer missed context, current approach is
intentional, or fixing violates YAGNI.
**Acknowledge:** "Fixed [CR-001]. Null check added." Not "Great catch!"
